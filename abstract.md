In the recent paper MV basis and DH measures BKK showed that the MV cycles define a (semi)perfect basis in the coordinate ring on the unipotent subgroup. Motivated by original work of J Anderson. In particular they showed that the product of two MV basis vectors in C[N] is given by intersection multiplicities appearing in the intersection of the BD degeneration of the product of the corresponding MV cycles with the central fibre. In this talk we describe how the Mirkovic--Vybornov isomorphism can be generalized to give a concrete way to compute such products in type A.
