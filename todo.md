Next meeting

- address some of the newer comments

Dimensions of fake MV cycles: 

Choose $w$ so that $w \mu$ is dominant.  Then the action of $w$ gives an isomorphism
$$Gr^\lambda \cap Gr_\mu \cap S^\mu \cong Gr^\lambda \cap Gr_{w\mu} \cap S^{w\mu}$$
This gives us the dimension of $Gr^\lambda \cap Gr_\mu \cap S^\mu$.
This also proves my "conjecture 1" from our conversation.  The number
of components of 
$$Gr^\lambda \cap Gr_\mu \cap S^\mu = dim V(\lambda)_{w\mu} = dim V(\lambda)_\mu$$

Further questions for Joel:

- what about the coproduct, the rest of the Hopf algebra structure
- why should we (the people) care? 
- contravariance vs covariance of IH
- positivity 
- ansatz making aka roger's explanation of how this helps to see if a cluster monomial is in the mv basis (a byproduct/application that will soon be rendered obsolete by Joel's ideas)
- the denouement 
- fake mv cycles 
- does it have to do with tensor product bases?

- what are we doing?
- fake MV cycles? comment on the fact that the calculations seem to work out for any pair $\mu_i$ such that the sum is dominant

- make sure that the image of our map is in the $G_1$ orbit
- more generally, define the map, check that the map is well-defined
- Anne: say what little a is, i.e.\ insert the MVy theorem as stated in CK, or thesis
- Roger: check it

- exactness of $-\otimes\mathbb C[[t]]$ it's flat so done (atiyah-macdonald?)
- lifting dominance assumption on $\mu_i$ because lemma 2.3 works fine 
- write the paper
- fill in the details of Theorem 2
- (reason 3 ..) applications/connections to clusters (don't do this)
- limitation of mvy to dominant mu
- (reason 2 ..) "easy" way to compute fusion
- (reason 1 why it's cool) a generalization of mvy 
- how the hill we find tableaux
   - we start with \nu\in Q_+ and we translate it; how do we find optimal translates: smallest mu_i and lambda_i 
   - possible fusion of tableaux rule? 
- how we recognize the components in the decomposition (which kinnna up to now uses cluster exchange relations)
- address AK conjecture: sum of polytopes/ld always occurs in decomposition with multiplicity 1
- move good stuff from main.tex to examples, or?

We know the MV cycle is not smooth because its polytope has a non-smooth vertex. Even though we don't see it from the affine coordinate ring. This is ok, the ring we have calculated is telling us some local info, away from the non-smooth point.

Atiyah-MacDonald, Proposition 10.14

- double check Roger's computation which seems to depend on the representative of tableau that we choose
- speculate about a combinatorial rule governing the multiplication
