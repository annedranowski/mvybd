- make sure that the image of our map is in the $G_1$ orbit
- more generally, define the map, check that the map is well-defined
- Anne: say what little a is, i.e.\ insert the MVy theorem as stated in CK, or thesis
- Roger: check it

- exactness of $-\otimes\mathbb C[[t]]$ it's flat so done (atiyah-macdonald?)
- lifting dominance assumption on $\mu_i$ because lemma 2.3 works fine 
- write the paper
- fill in the details of Theorem 2
- (reason 3 ..) applications/connections to clusters (don't do this)
- limitation of mvy to dominant mu
- (reason 2 ..) "easy" way to compute fusion
- (reason 1 why it's cool) a generalization of mvy 
- how the hill we find tableaux
   - we start with \nu\in Q_+ and we translate it; how do we find optimal translates: smallest mu_i and lambda_i 
   - possible fusion of tableaux rule? 
- how we recognize the components in the decomposition (which kinnna up to now uses cluster exchange relations)
- address AK conjecture: sum of polytopes/ld always occurs in decomposition with multiplicity 1
- move good stuff from main.tex to examples, or?

- double check Roger's computation which seems to depend on the representative of tableau that we choose
- speculate about a combinatorial rule governing the multiplication
