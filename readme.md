overlaps with todo file: contains old todo notes; also contains some questions, project goal, some refs

## goal

extend MVy, D to BD grassmannian toward computing multiplicities of fusion products

## todo 

1. S^mu_BD is contained in W^mu_BD if mu is dominant should follow from Prop 2.6 in KWWY (Cor 5.2.2 in my thesis) and Appendix B(ix) in BFN2, where they apparently show that BD is contained in thick.

        in type A Gr_BD is literally G((t,t-s))/G[[t,t-s]]
        what do we replace S with? 
        in other types also?

        New! consider in family, i.e. define S^mu for BD as in the case of the ordinary Grassmannian

2. Does S^mu_BD correspond to block upper triangular matrices under MVy

        what do we replace O_lambda and T_mu with on the other side of the MVy iso
        see MVy global case construction: two step flags such that t acts by (0,s) on the two quotients 
        also from CK section 3.5 we should know what to replace T_mu with
        T_\mu should be replaced with T_\mu[s]

## questions

- bd vs convolution? roger says there's a map from convolution to bd, will find notes
- local vs global?
- MVy 19 construction of psi? 
- BFN2 & CKSymmetricHowe both imply S_BD is in W_BD when mu is dominant? 
    - do we need them?
