\section{Introduction}
% 
The Mirkovic--Vybornov isomorphism (\cite{mirkovic2007quiver,mirkovic2019comparison}) relates slices in the affine Grassmannian to slices in conjugacy classes of nilpotent matrices and Nakajima quiver varieties. In so doing it provides a geometric version of symmetric and skew Howe $(\GL_m,\GL_n)$ dualities. 
% 

[Liaison]

The Beilinson--Drinfeld Grassmannian, essential to \cite{mirkovic2007geometric}, is a space which is used to define a fusion (aka convolution) product on sheaves (representations) as well as MV cycles (bases). 
% 
This product structure makes the vector space spanned by the MV cycles into a commutative algebra isomorphic to the ring of functions on the unipotent subgroup (conjectured in \cite{anderson2003polytope} and proved in \cite{baumann2019mirkovic}). % conjectured by JEA and proved by BKK
% 
To quote from Mirkovic and Vilonen:
\begin{quotation}
    However, we make crucial use of an idea of Drinfeld, going back to around 1990. He discovered an elegant way of obtaining the commutativity constraint by interpreting the convolution product of sheaves as a ``fusion'' product.
\end{quotation}
% 
[Liaison]

The purpose of this paper is to give an elementary way to compute this product in type $A$. We do not know how fruitful this work might be in the larger landscape of geometric representation theory as it is plagued by two major limitations: it does not readily generalize outside of type $A$, and it is as yet computationally expensive. 
% 
Moreover, it is not clear why one should care about the fusion product on bases. \emoji{smile} \emoji{grin} \emoji{worried} \emoji{monocle-face} \emoji{skull}

\section{Players}

Fix $G = \GL_m$ and let $T\subset G$ be the maximal torus of diagonal matrices. 
% are there other possibilities?? :S 
Write $P$ for the character lattice of $T$. Identify $P\cong \ZZ^m$ so that the set of dominant weights $P_+$ is given by the set of partitions having at most $m$ nonzero parts. Set $\cO = \CC\xt$ and $\cK = \CC\xT$. We will also need the notation $\cO_s$ for the completion of the local ring $\CC[t]$ at $s\in\spec\CC$ and $\cK_s$ for its fraction field $\CC\xT[t-s]$. 
% TODO: given by or described by?
% 
Note that (by changing the local coordinate on $\spec\CC[t]$ to $t-s$) we can identify $\cO_s \cong \cO$ and $\cK_s\cong\cK$. 

% Set $\AA = \AA^1_x$ (the subscript denoting the chosen local coordinate) and fix $s\in \AA - \{0\}$. 

\subsection{Lattices}
\label{ss:lat}
We will use the lattice model, so it is useful to recall the following definition.  Let $ R \subset K$ be two rings (usually, but not always, $K $ will be a field).  Let $ n \in \mathbb N$ and consider $ K^n $ as a $K$-module.   By restriction $ K^n$ can be viewed as an $R$-module.  An $R$-lattice in $ M$ is an $R$-submodule $ L \subset K^n$ such that $ L $ is a free rank $ n $ $R$-module and $ L \otimes_R K = K^n $.  Equivalently $ L = \Sp_R(v_1, \dots, v_n)$ where $ v_1, \dots, v_n$ are free generators of $K^n$.  

The trivial lattice is $L_0 = R^n \subset K^n $.  The group $\GL_n(K) $ acts simply transitively on the set of $ R$-lattices in $K^n$ and we obtain a bijection between the set of such lattices and $\GL_n(K)/\GL_n(R)$.

We will be particularly interested in $\CC[t]$-lattices in $ \CC[t,t^{-1}]^n$.  Given such a lattice $ L $ and a point $ a \in \CC$, the specialization of $ L $ at $ a $ is defined as
$$
L(a) := L \otimes_{\CC[t]} \CC[[t-a]] \subset \CC((t-a))\,.
$$
In particular we say that $ L $ is trivial at $ a $ if $ L(a) = \CC[[t-a]]^n.$

\jcom{I wasn't sure of the notation to use here, but I wanted something which didn't conflict with $ L_0$.}

\acom{I think that MVy use this notation also:

\subsection{Affine Grassmannians} %  actors

Set $\AA = \AA^1$ and $\PP = \PP^1$. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item The ordinary affine Grassmannian $\Gr = G(\cK)/G(\cO)$. It is described in modular terms by 
    $$
    \Gr = \{ (P, \varphi) : \text{$V$ is a rank $n$ vector bundle on $ \PP $, $\varphi : V \rightarrow V_0 $ on $ \PP \setminus \{0\} $} \} 
    $$
    where $V_0$ is the trivial rank $n$ vector bundle on $\PP$.
    
    We also have a lattice description 
    $$ 
    \Gr = \{ L \subset \CC^n \otimes_\cO \cK : \text{ $L$ is a $\cO$-lattice} \}
    $$
    % 
    \item For any $ s \in \CC $, the ordinary affine Grassmannian $\Gr_s = G(\cK_s)/G(\cO_s)$ at $ s $. It is described in modular terms by
    $$
    \Gr_s = \{ (P, \varphi) : \text{$V$ is a rank $n$ vector bundle on $ \PP $, $\varphi : V \rightarrow V_0 $ on $ \PP \setminus \{s\} $} \} 
    $$
    We also have a lattice description 
    $$ \Gr_s = \{ L \subset \CC^n \otimes_{\cO_s} \cK_s : \text{ $L$ is a $\cO_s$-lattice} \}
$$   
    \item The thick affine Grassmannian $\Gr^{\sf th} = G(\CC\xT[t^{-1}])/G(\CC[t])$. It is described in modular terms by
    $$
        \Grth = \{ (P, \varphi) : \text{$V$ is a rank $n$ vector bundle on $ \PP $, $\varphi : V \rightarrow V_0 $ on $ D_\infty $ } \} % (a disk centered at $ \infty$)
    $$
    where $D_\infty$ denotes a disk centered at $ \infty$.
    We also have a lattice description 
$$ 
\Gr^{\sf th} = \{ L \subset \CC^n \otimes_{\CC[t]} \CC((t^{-1})) : \text{ $L$ is a $\CC[t]$-lattice} \}
$$   
\jcom{Maybe write $\cK_\infty$ for $ \CC\xT[t^{-1}] $?  Also maybe change the ``thick'' notation''. I made a $\Grth$ macro, but I had no idea where to put it.}

    \item The (two point) Beilinson--Drinfeld Grassmannian $\pi : \Grbd\to \AA$ (with one point fixed at 0, and the second point $s$ varying away from $s = 0$).
    It is described in modular terms by
    {\small
    $$
    \Grbd = 
    % \begin{aligned}
        \left\{ 
            (P,\varphi,s) : V\text{ is a rank $n$ vector bundle on }\PP, \varphi : V \rightarrow V_0 \text{ on } \PP \setminus \{0, s\}  
        \right\} 
    % \end{aligned}
    $$}
    The fibre of $\Grbd \to \AA$ over $ s \in \AA $, for $ s \ne 0$, will be denoted $ \Gr_{0,s} $ and is given by
    $$ \Gr_{0,s} := \pi^{-1}(s) = G(\CC[t, t^{-1}, (t-s)^{-1})/G(\CC[t])$$
    
    We also have a lattice description 
    {\small
    $$ 
    \Grbd = 
    \{ L \subset \CC^n \otimes_{\CC[t]} \CC[t,t^{-1}], s \in \CC : \text{ $L$ is a $\CC[t]$-lattice 
    % , $L$ is 
    trivial at any $ a \ne 0, s$} \}
    $$}
    % 
\end{itemize}

These different versions of the affine Grassmannian are related as follows.  First there is an isomorphism $ \Gr \cong \Gr_s $ coming from the isomorphism $ \Ks \cong \K$.

Second, we have a map $$ \Grbd \rightarrow \Grth $$ which is given in modular terms by restricting the trivialization to $ D_\infty$.  It is given in group-theoretic terms on the fibre over $ s $ by
$$
G(\CC[t, t^{-1}, (t-s)^{-1}])/ G(\CC[t]) \rightarrow G(\CC((t^{-1}))/G(\C[t])
$$
Finally, it is given in lattice terms as the identity on the lattice and using the inclusion $\CC[t, t^{-1}, (t-s)^{-1}]^n \rightarrow \CC((t^{-1}))^n$ on the ambient spaces.

The fibres $ Gr_{0,s}$ of $ \Grbd \rightarrow \AA$ are given as follows
$$
\Gr_{0,s} \cong \begin{cases} \Gr \times \Gr_s, \  s \ne 0 \\
\Gr, \ s = 0.
\end{cases}
$$
This isomorphism is given in the lattice realization as
$$
L \mapsto (L(0), L(s))
$$
in the $ s \ne 0 $ case.

The following construction will be very important in this paper.  Let $ X_1, X_2 \subset \Gr$ be two subschemes.  Then using the isomorphism $ \Gr \cong \Gr_s $ for each $ s$, we obtain a subscheme $ X_1 \times X_2 \subset \Gr \times \Gr_s $.  Via this isomorphism $ \Gr_{0,s} \cong \Gr \times \Gr_s $,  for each $ s \ne 0$, we obtain a subscheme $ X_1 \times X_2 \times \AA^\times $  of $\Grbd$.  We define $ X_1 * X_2 $ to be the scheme theoretic closure of $ X_1 \times X_2 \times \AA^\times $ inside of $ \Grbd $.  We have the projection $ \pi: \Grbd \rightarrow \A $ and we form $ X_1 \cdot X_2 = X_1 * X_2 \cap \pi^{-1}(0) = \Gr_{0,0} $, which we call the fusion of $ X_1 $ and $X_2$.  We regard $ X_1 \cdot X_2$ as a subscheme of $ \Gr $ using the isomorphism $\Gr_{0,0} \cong \Gr $.

\jcom{I thought that it would be good to introduce this operation now, since we will use it often in the paper. I don't know what notation we should use.}

Now fix dominant weights $ \lambda_i \in P_+$ of size $N_i$ ($i=1,2$) and their sum $ \lambda = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2$ of size $ N = N_1 + N_2$.

% 
\begin{itemize}
    % \item Weights $\mu_i\le\lambda_i$ of size $N_i$ ($i=1,2$) 
    % \item Their sums $\mu = \sum \mu_i \le \lambda = \sum\lambda_i$ of size $N = \sum N_i$
    \item The point $L_\lambda = t^\lambda G(\cO)$ in $\Gr$ 
    \item The orbit $\Gr^\lambda = G(\cO) L_\lambda$ and its closure $ \overline{\Gr}^\lambda = \cup_{\lambda' \le \lambda} \Gr^{\lambda'}$.
    \item The family $ \overline{\Gr}^{\lambda_1, \lambda_2} \rightarrow \A$, defined by $ \overline{\Gr}^{\lambda_1, \lambda_2} = \overline{Gr}^{\lambda_1} * \overline{Gr}^{\lambda_2}$.  By construction the fibre of $ \overline{\Gr}^{\lambda_1, \lambda_2} $ over $ s \ne 0 $ is $ \overline{\Gr}^{\lambda_1} \times \overline{\Gr}^{\lambda_2}$.  By Zhu's theorem (\jcom{need ref}), the fibre over $ 0 $ is $ \overline{\Gr}^{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2}$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    %The family $\overline{\Gr}_\AA^{\lambda_1,\lambda_2}\to\AA$ whose generic fibre is $\overline{\Gr}^{\lambda_1} \times \overline{\Gr}^{\lambda_2}$ and whose zero fibre is $\Gr^{\lambda}$ \acom{1. and closures? 2. can probably be described as an orbit of some group scheme} 
    \item The slice $\Gr_\mu = G_1[t^{-1}]L_\mu$ to the orbit $\Gr^\lambda$
    \item The ``slice'' $\cW_\mu = G_1\xT[t^{-1}] t^\mu G(\CC[t])$ to the ``orbit'' $\Gr_\AA^{\lambda_1,\lambda_2}$ \acom{is not presented as a family}% $(\Grbd[2])^{\lambda_1,\lambda_2}$; replaced \cW_{\mu_1,\mu_2} = by Joel's not'n & def, seemingly independent of the decomposition of \mu; modified Joel's double bracket --- still confused over where W_\mu ought to live 
\end{itemize}
The following notation leaves the realm of affine Grassmannians and probably deserves its own subsection. E.g.\ ``nilpotent cones?''
\begin{itemize}
    \item The nilpotent and semi-nilpotent cones $\cN$ and $\cN_\AA$ (of matrices with eigenvalues in $\{0\}$ and $\{0,s\} \in \AA\times\AA$ resp.) 
    \item The slice $\TT_\mu$ to the orbit $\OO_\lambda$ 
    \item The ``family of slices'' $\TT_{\mu_1,\mu_2}^{\AA}$ to the ``family of orbits'' $\OO^{\AA}_{\lambda_1,\lambda_2}$ \acom{ok to describe as such?}
\end{itemize}

% New (?) definitions among these are as follows.
% 
%The [family of] slices [with $s$-fibre?]
%\begin{equation}
%    \cW_{\mu_1,\mu_2} = G_1 [t^{-1},(t-s)^{-1}]L_{\mu_1,\mu_2}
%\end{equation}

Recall (citation?) that there is an embedding of the usual (``thin'') affine Grassmannian $\Gr $ as we have defined it into the ``thick'' affine Grassmannian. 
% 

\acom{In \cite{kamnitzer2014yangians} the thick Gr is said to be necessary for the noncommutative algebras considered. What is our reason for preferring it to the thin Gr? Can we replace thick by thin? Joel said that rather it is needed/used because unlike the thin $\Gr$ which is an ind-scheme, the thick $\Gr^{\sf th}$ is a scheme, so taking Spec of global functions (on $\cW_\mu$?) will recover $\cW_\mu$?}
\[
\Gr \cong G(\CC[t,t^{-1}])/G(\CC[t])\hookrightarrow \Gr^{\sf th} := G(\CC\xT[t^{-1}])/G(\CC[t]) \quad g\cO \mapsto gG(\CC[t])  \,.
\]
Let 
% $L_\mu = t^\mu G(\cO)$ and 
$L_{\mu_1, \mu_2} = t^{\mu_1} (t-s)^{\mu_2} G(\CC[t])$.

% 
Note that $ L_{\mu_1, \mu_2} = (t-s)^{\mu_2} t^{-\mu_2} L_{\mu} \in \cW_\mu$ 
% \acom{thick or thin}
and that  $L_{\mu_1,\mu_2}\in\Grbd$ \acom{should say $\Grbd[s]$ as it's really a lattice in a given fibre being characterized?} is a $\CC[t]$-lattice in $\CC(t)^m$ that specializes to a $\CC\xt$-lattice in $\CC\xT^m$ away from $t = 0$ and away from $t = s$, i.e.\

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:defWBD}
    % \begin{split}
        %L_{\mu_1,\mu_2}\otimes \CC[(t-s)^{-1}] =
        L_{\mu_1,\mu_2}\otimes \CC\xt = L_{\mu_2} \otimes \CC\xt \qquad
        L_{\mu_1,\mu_2}\otimes \CC\xt[t-s] = L_{\mu_1} \otimes \CC\xt[t-s]
    % \end{split}
\end{equation}
where 
% $L_{\mu_i}$ denotes the point $t^{\mu_i}G(\cO)\in\Gr$ and 
the tensor product is taken over $\CC[t]$. 
% 

The family of semi-infinite orbits 
\begin{equation}
    S_{\mu_1,\mu_2} = N_-(\CC\xT[t^{-1}]) L_{\mu_1,\mu_2}\,. 
\end{equation}
\acom{1. Introduce $N_\pm$. 2. In \cite{kamnitzer2014yangians} the global version of $S^\mu_-$ is the subvariety $S^\mu_{-,\AA}\subset\Grbd$ whose generic fibre is $\bigcup_{\mu_1 + \mu_2 = \mu} S^{\mu_1}_-\times S^{\mu_2}_-$ and whose zero fibre is $S^\mu_-$ which don't look to be the same thing.}

The family \acom{orbit? orbits? family of orbits?} of $\CC[t]$-lattices in $\CC(t)^m$ whose elements specialize again to $\CC\xt$-lattices in $\CC\xT^m$ away from $t = 0$ and away from $t = s$ (i.e.\ which are trivial at $a \ne 0$ or $s$, to use the terminology introduced in the \cref{ss:lat}) is described more explicitly as follows
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:defGrBDlambda}
    \begin{split}
        % (\Grbd[2])^{\lambda_1,\lambda_2} = 
        \Gr_{\AA}^{\lambda_1,\lambda_2} = 
        \{L \in\Grbd : 
        %L\otimes\CC[t^{-1}] 
        L \otimes_{\CC[t]} \CC\xt[t-s] 
        &\in \Gr^{\lambda_2} \text{ and } \\
        % L\otimes\CC[(s-t)^{-1}] 
        L\otimes_{\CC[t]} \CC\xt &\in \Gr^{\lambda_1} \text{ and } \\ 
        L \otimes_{\CC[t]} \CC\xt[t-a] &= L_0 \text{ for all $ a \ne 0, s$} \}\,.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

% \jcom{It is important to add the condition that the lattices are trivial at $ a $.} \acom{$a\ne 0,s$}
% 
% \acom{These defining conditions are again just telling us that in the fibre over the fixed point $(0,s)\in C^{(2)}$ this set is pairs of lattices; note that we invert the indeterminates $t$ and $(t-s)$ \textit{after} specializing $(0,s)$. Could we give a more explicit characterization like $t^{N_1}(t-s)^{N_2} L_0 \subseteq L\subseteq t^{-N_1}(t-s)^{-N_2}$?}

\section{Exposition}

Anderson and Kogan conjectured in \cite{anderson2006algebra} \acom{or earlier?} that those MV polynomials which are cluster monomials for a Fomin--Zelevinsky cluster algebra structure on $\CC[N]$ are naturally expressible as determinants\dots
% and they conjectured a formula for many of them.

It's not clear how this work helps with/relates to AK/their conjectures.

The generalized MVy is interesting in its own right. \acom{is it?}

Computing fusion still hard but at least boiled down to linear algebra. Cf.\ fusion product as it appears in BD, FL, MV, AK, BFM.

Interesting combinatorics? Witnessing a product on SSYT.

Exchange relations only work on cluster modules where one is a mutation of the other (i.e.\ those corresponding to cluster monomials which are related by mutation). Of course this gives me everything. Up to $A_4$ as in type $A_5$ there exist indecomposable modules which are not cluster, so exchange relations do not apply. The hope (conjecture) is that this paper gives a way to compute on such modules. Cf.\ counterexample satisfying $\barD(c_Y) = \barD(b_Z) + 2\barD(b)$, where $b$ is (possibly) cluster, and suggesting that $c_Y = b_Z + 2b$. Can still consider $ext(M_Z)$. Say $b_Z^2 = b_{Z_1} + b_{Z_2}$. 

% No; $x*y=\sum z\Rightarrow y = \frac 1 x \sum z$. 

Representation theory?

\begin{theorem}
    Let $\lambda_i\ge\mu_i$ be dominant ($i=1,2$), $\mu = \mu_1 +\mu_2$, and $\lambda =\lambda_1+\lambda_2$. 
    % I have an irrational dislike of ending sentences with subscripts --- can we fix this?
    There is an isomorphism 
    \begin{equation}
        \overline{\OO}_{\lambda_1,\lambda_2}\cap\TT_{\mu_1,\mu_2} \to \overline\Gr_\AA^{\lambda_1,\lambda_2}\cap \cW_{\mu_1,\mu_2}
    \end{equation}
    got by taking a $\mu\times\mu$ block matrix $A$ in the $s$-fibre $\overline{\OO_{\lambda_1,\lambda_2}^s}\cap\TT_{\mu_1,\mu_2}^s$ on the left to the representative of the $s$-fibre on the right defined by  
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            g &= t^{\mu_1} (t-s)^{\mu_2} + a(t) \\
            a_{ij}(t) &= - \sum_{k=1}^{\mu_i} A^k_{ji} t^{k-1}
        \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    where $A^k_{ji}$ is the $k$th entry from the left of the last row of the $\mu_j\times\mu_i$ block of $A$. 
\end{theorem}

Let's call this the MVyBD isomorphism.

\begin{proof}
    The proof is fibre by fibre, so fix $s\ne 0$. \acom{Emphasize in the intro later (because this always confuses me) that by the $s$-fibre we really mean the $(0,s)$-fibre; i.e.\ its the BD Grassmannian over the second symmetric power of $C = \AA^1$; better just replace $s$-fibre by $(0,s)$-fibre everywhere it occurs.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The map is well defined. In particular, it defines $\CC[t]$-lattices in $\CC(t)^m$. Moreover, these lattices break down to give pairs of lattices upon inverting $t$ or $t-s$ that have the right properties. [Copy Roger's proof]
        \item The inverse map is got by taking the matrix of multiplication by $t$.  More precisely, let $ L \in Gr^{BD} \cap \cW_\mu$.  We work with the quotient $\CC[t]^m/L$ just as in the ordinary MVy isomorphism---the only difference being $\CC\xt$ is replaced by $\CC[t]$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    We claim that 
    \begin{equation}
        \{[e_i],[te_i],\dots,[t^{\mu_{i}-1}e_i] : 1\le i \le m\}
    \end{equation}
    is a $\CC$-basis of $\CC[t]^m/L$.
    
    To see this, we use that $ L $ 
 has a $\CC[t]$-basis of the form 
    \begin{equation}
        v_i = t^{\mu_i} + \sum_{j>i} p_{ij}(t) e_j 
    \end{equation}
    with $\deg p_{ij}(t) < \mu_i = \mu_{1,i} + \mu_{2,i}$ ($1\le i\le m$).
    \acom{I don't know why this should be true. We might have to just define fibres of $\cW_{\mu_1,\mu_2}$ in this way?}
    \item $t\big|_{\CC[t]^m/L}$ will have two eigenvalues, 0 and $s$, and its generalized 0-eigenspace will have block type $\le \lambda_1$ while its generalized $s$-eigenspace will have block type $\le \lambda_2$. 
    To see this, note that there is a natural isomorphism
    $$\CC[[t]]^m/(L \otimes_{\CC[t]} \CC[[t]]) = \text{generalized $0$ eigenspace of $t$ on } \CC[t]^m/L$$
    carrying the action of $t $ to the action of $t$.
    
    The left hand side is the same thing as
    $$ \CC[[t]]^m / (L \otimes_{\CC[t]} \CC[[t]]) = (\CC[t]^m/L) \otimes_{\CC[t]} \CC[[t]] $$
    
    the defining fact that lattices satisfying Equation~\ref{eq:defGrBDlambda} equivalently satisfy 
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            t\big|_{\CC\xt^m/L_1}\text{ has Jordan type} \le \lambda_1 \\
            t\big|_{\CC\xt^m/L_2}\text{ has Jordan type} \le \lambda_2 
        \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    where recall 
    $L_i = L\otimes \CC\xt$ ??? 
    % $L_i = L\otimes \CC[(t-p_i)^{-1}]$ 
    and $p_1 = s$ while $p_2 = 0$. \acom{Somehow, restricting to an eigenspace is like inverting/forgetting the action of $t$ by any other generalized eigenvalue? Basic linear algebra? Joel?}
\end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{theorem}[Theorem 1 version 2]
    Let $\lambda_1,\lambda_2$ and $\mu$ 
    %be dominant
    be arbitrary, such that $\lambda = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 \ge \mu$. Then there is an isomorphism 
    \begin{equation}
        \overline{\OO_{\lambda_1,\lambda_2}} \cap \TT_\mu \to \overline{\Grbd[2]^{\lambda_2,\lambda_2}}\cap\cW_\mu 
    \end{equation}
    defined by the same map as in Theorem 1.
\end{theorem}

\jcom{This is true as stated with the ``larger'' definition of $ \cW_\mu $.  In fact, for any $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$, it is true $ \overline{\Grbd[2]^{\lambda_2,\lambda_2}}\cap\cW_\mu $ is contained in a subset that we could call $ \cW_\mu^s$ which we could define as
$$
\cW_\mu^s = G_1[[t^{-1}]]t^\mu \cap G[t,t^{-1}, (t-s)^{-1}] / G[t]
$$
where we regard $G[t,t^{-1}, (t-s)^{-1}] / G[t] \subset G((t^{-1}))/G[t] $

The way to think about this is as follows: inside the thick affine Grassmannian we can consider the $G$-bundles trivialized away from just 0, $s$, or equivalently those lattices which become the standard lattice after tensoring with $ \CC[[t-a]] $ for any $ a \ne 0, s$.
}
\begin{corollary}
    The MVyBD isomorphism restricts to an isomorphism of subfamilies 
    \begin{equation}
        \overline{\OO_{\lambda_1,\lambda_2}}\cap\TT_{\mu_1,\mu_2}^+ \to \overline{(\Grbd[2])^{\lambda_1,\lambda_2}}\cap S_{\mu_1,\mu_2}\,. 
    \end{equation}
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    Let $ A \in \overline{\OO_{\lambda_1,\lambda_2}}\cap\TT_{\mu_1,\mu_2}^+$ and let $ g $ be the polynomial matrix formed by the Mirkovic-Vybornov isomorphism.  Then the diagonal entries of $ g $ are $ t^{\mu_{1,k}} (t-s)^{\mu_{2,k}}$ and we can factor
    $$ g = (g t^{-\mu_1}(t-s)^{-\mu_2}) t^{\mu_1}(t-s)^{\mu_2} \in N[t, t^{-1}, (t-s)^{-1}] t^{\mu_1} (t-s)^{\mu_2}$$
    So we get containment in one direction.
    
    For the reverse containment, we choose $ [g] \in \overline{(\Grbd[2])^{\lambda_1,\lambda_2}}\cap S_{\mu_1,\mu_2}$.  By the lemma below, $[g] \in \cW_\mu$ and thus it lies in the image of our map and we are done.
\end{proof}

% Define $S_{\mu_1,\mu_2}^s = N_-\xT[t^{-1}] t^{\mu_1} (t-s)^{\mu_2}$. 

\acom{is it a fibre of $S_{\mu_1,\mu_2}$ defined above?}

We could also make the following claim. 


\begin{lemma}[KWWY14]
    Let $\mu$ be dominant. Then 
    \begin{equation}
        N_{-}\xT[t^{-1}] L_\mu = N_1\xt[t^{-1}]L_\mu
    \end{equation}
    \acom{where I am not sure about the double brackets.}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}%[Roger's lemma]
    Let $\mu_1,\mu_2$ be dominant and let $s\in \AA^1 - \{0\}$. Then 
    \begin{equation}
        S_{\mu_1,\mu_2}^s \subset \cW_\mu 
    \end{equation}
    where $\mu = \mu_1 + \mu_2$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    % Copy Roger's proof.
    We have
\[
\begin{split}
    S_{\mu_1, \mu_2} & = N((t^{-1}))t^{\mu_1}(t-s)^{\mu_2} \\
     & \subset T_1[[t^{-1}]] N((t^{-1})) t^{\mu_1} (t-s)^{\mu_2} \\
     & = T_1[[t^{-1}]] N_1[[t^{-1}]] t^{\mu_1} (t-s)^{\mu_2} \qquad \text{\cite[Lemma 2.3]{kamnitzer2014yangians}}\\
     & = B_1[[t^{-1}]] t^{\mu_1} (t-s)^{\mu_2} \\
     & = B_1[[t^{-1}]] t^{\mu_1 + \mu_2} \\
     & \subset G_1[[t^{-1}]] t^{\mu_1 + \mu_2} \\
     & = W_{\mu_1 + \mu_2}
\end{split}
\]
where $B_1[[t^{-1}]] t^{\mu_1} (t-s)^{\mu_2} = B_1[[t^{-1}]] t^{\mu_1 + \mu_2}$ since 
\[
\frac{t}{t-s} = 
1 + \frac{s}{t} + \frac{s^2}{t^2} + \cdots 
\in B_1[[t^{-1}]].
\]
\end{proof}

\section{Denouement}

As an application we can compute fusion of stable MV cycles of type $\alpha_i$ for any $i \in I$. What about more general weights? Having $\kpf > 1$.

\begin{proposition}
    % Given two MV cycles $Z_\tau$ and $Z_\sigma$ of type\dots 
    Let $Z_{i} = Z_{\tau_i}$  be an MV cycle of type $\lambda_i\in P_+$ and weight $\mu_i\in P$ ($i = 1,2$). Then 
    \begin{equation}
        % Z_\tau\ast Z_\sigma 
        m_{\lambda_1\lambda_2} ([Z_1]\otimes[Z_2]) = \sum_{Z\in\cZ(\lambda)_\mu} i\left(
            Z,\pi^{-1}(0)\cdot\overline{Z_1\times Z_2\times U}
        \right) [Z]
    \end{equation}
    is found by\dots 
    In particular, the multiplicity of $Z_\tau$ in the product of the zero fiber 
    % (divisor class) 
    and the 
    % (Zariski) 
    closure of the family $Z_1 \times Z_2 \times U$ is equal to the multiplicity of $X_\tau$ among 
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:tabmult}
        \irr \lim_{s\to 0} \overline\OO^s_{\lambda_1,\lambda_2} \cap \TT_{\mu_1,\mu_2}^{+,s}
    \end{equation}
    and since stable MV cycles can be represented by ordinary ones the multiplicities in 
    $$
    b_{Z_1}b_{Z_2} = \sum_{Z\in\cZ(\infty)_{-\nu_1 - \nu_2}} i \left(
        Z, \pi^{-1}(0) \cdot \overline{Z_1 \times Z_2 \times U}
    \right) b_Z 
    $$
    can also be deduced from \cref{eq:tabmult} for appropriate choices of $\lambda_i$ and $\mu_i$ ($i = 1,2$).
\end{proposition}
\acom{or Corollary?}

\begin{conjecture}
    % Let $Z_i \subset \overline{S^{\nu_i}\cap S^0_-}$ be an MV cycle of weight $\nu_i$ ($i = 1,2$) and put $\nu = \nu_1 + \nu_2$. 
    Let $\tau$ be the tableau of shape $\lambda$ and weight $\mu$ whose Lusztig datum is equal to the sum of the Lusztig data of $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$. 
    % Then $i(\tau, \pi^{-1}(0) \cdot \overline{\tau_1 \times \tau_2 \times U})$ is equal to 1. 
    Then 
    \begin{equation}
        i(\tau, \pi^{-1}(0) \cdot \overline{\tau_1 \times \tau_2 \times U}) = 1 \,. 
    \end{equation}
\end{conjecture}
